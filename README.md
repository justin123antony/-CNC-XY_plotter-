# -CNC-XY_plotter-
 X-Y pen plotter-developed from scratch. It consist of two stepper motors (bipolar, step angle-3.75degree)-Minebea 16PU-M202, Stepper Drivers-L293D H bridge, 7805 regulators, Atmega 328P-8 bit-AVR MCU (I2C protocol).  The two stepper motor controls the movement along X -Y directions and TowerPro SG90 Servo motor is the actuator for Z axis movement of Pen.  We have implemented G-Code algorithm using Java programming language (processing 3.0 software).
